> Store, search, and collaborate on web bookmarks, powered by GitHub. 🎩

This is an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) 🎩 workflow for people who are up to here 🫳 with it with link sprawl already. Store your web bookmarks in a public repo on GitHub – totally normal 🤭 – and share with your besties. Or don't, I'm ok with it. We made private repos just for you.

Then, navigate to your favorite links in like a couple of keystrokes, wow! ⚡️

Requires a paid [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).

## Usage
- `ghl alias` – search for a bookmark by alias
- `ghl #tag` – search for a bookmark by tag
